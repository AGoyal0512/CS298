\\nPurpose\\n \\nThe purpose of the \\nAnalysis of Impediments to Fair Housing Choice\\n \\n(AI) is to \\nidentify practices and \\nconditions in the City that are \\nimpeding\\n \\nhousing opportunities for residents \\nbecause of their\\n \\nrace, color, \\nnational origin, religion, sex, disability, or \\nother \\n\\nstatus.  \\nFair housing impediments \\ninclude \\ndirect\\n \\ndiscriminatory\\n \\nactions, omissions or decisions \\nrelated\\n \\nto \\n \\nmembership in a protected class\\n, \\nor \\nindirect\\n \\nactions, omissions\\n \\nor decisions \\nthat\\n \\nhave the effect of\\n \\nrestricting housing choices for people \\nspecifically because of their protected class membership\\n.\\n \\n \\n\\nAffirmatively Further Fair H\\n\\nT\\nhe AI identifies \\nfair housing \\ncho\\nice constraints \\nand \\noffers\\n \\nplanning strategies that \\ncan be incorporated into other\\n \\ncommunity planning and development\\n \\nprocesses and decisions\\n. \\nThis study i\\ns required by the Department \\nof Housing and Urban Development \\n(HUD) \\nas a condition for receiving fede\\nral housing funds.  It should \\nbe \\ncompleted \\nbefore the City creates its five\\n-\\n\\nbe spen\\nt, so that the City can show that it understands the various direct and indirect impediments to fair \\nhousing cho\\nice and is actively working to eliminate discriminatory practices and \\ndisparate outcomes\\n. \\n \\n \\nOverview of Study\\n \\nT\\nhe City of Madison hired MSA Professional Services to complete an AI\\n \\nfor the City\\n. The AI combines \\ndata available from a wide variety of sources,\\n \\nincluding population, demographic, economic and housing \\ndata from the American Community Survey, \\nThe \\nUS Department of Housing and Urban Development \\n(HUD), the \\nFederal Financial Institutions Examination Council\\n, and the City of Madison.

All levels of government grant \\nexceptions for the benefit of elderly and disabled residents, such that it is legal to offer hou\\nsing designated \\nspecifically for such residents\\n, and to discriminate against younger residents and persons without \\ndisabilities\\n.\\n  \\nSimilarly, Dane County allows discrimination by gender \\nin the case of single\\n-\\nsex housing.\\n  \\n \\n \\nMost levels of government \\nallow d\\niscrimination based on criminal convictions for certain crimes\\n \\nthat \\ncould put\\n \\nother tenants or employees at risk. \\nTo a limited extent, housing occupants are allowed to \\ndiscriminate \\n \\nin the selection of other occupants, including roommates, as long as there\\n \\nare \\nfive or fewer\\n \\npeople in the same unit.\\n  \\nOwner\\n-\\noccupants\\n \\nof \\nbuildings with four or fewer units are permitted by federal \\nlaw to discriminate against their renters, but this means only that the federal government cannot pursue a \\ndiscrimination case in th\\nese circumstances.  This exception is not included in State, County, or City laws, \\nmeaning that all landlords are required to comply with fair housing requirements as defined at each of \\nthose levels, including duplex owners.\\n \\n \\n \\nWhat is Required to Affirmati\\nvely Further Fair Housing?\\n \\n \\nThe federal mandate to affirmatively further fair house (AFFH) has never included clear directives \\nregarding how to fulfill this obligation.  H\\nowever, HUD defines it as requiring a grantee to:\\n \\n\\n \\nConduct an analysis to identify imp\\nediments (AI) to fair housing choice within the jurisdiction\\n, \\n \\n\\n \\nTake appropriate actions to overcome any impediments identified through the analysis\\n, and \\n \\n\\n \\nMaintain AFFH records. \\n \\nBeyond these requirements, the intent is that the City will take proactive ste\\nps to overcome historic \\npatterns of segregation, promote fair housing choice, and foster inclusive communities for all.\\n \\n \\nWhat are Impediments to Fair Housing Choice?\\n \\n \\nThere are\\n \\ntwo types of impediments to fair housing choice\\n, as defined by HUD and restated\\n \\nhere for \\nclarity\\n:\\n \\n\\n \\nDirect impediments\\n:  any \\nactions, omissions, or decisions \\nthat\\n \\ndirectly restrict housing choices\\n \\nor \\nthe \\navailability\\n \\nof housing choices based on \\n \\nrace, color, religion, sex, disability, familial status, \\nnational origin, or other protecte\\nd class \\nstatus;\\n \\n\\n \\nIndirect impediments\\n:  any \\nactions, omissions, or decisions which \\nhave t\\nhe effect\\n \\nof restricting \\nhousing choices or the \\navailability\\n \\nof housing choices\\n \\nby resulting in conditions in which \\nmembers of protected classes experience disparate ou\\ntcomes as compared to the general \\npopulation.\\n \\n \\nAny policies, practices, or procedures that may appear neutral but operate to deny or adversely affect the \\navailability of housing to a person may be considered an\\n \\nindirect\\n \\nimpediment.

Much of the data \\nwas derived from secondary sources, consisting \\n\\nprimarily of the U.S. Census and the American \\nCommunity Survey. \\nCaution should be used when interpreting the \\ndata from secondary sources.   The United States \\n\\nhas transitioned from the Census long-form \\nto the American Community Survey (ACS).  The \\n\\nmajority of the data that the American \\nCommunity Survey collects is from a sample of \\nthe total population; and therefore, is subject to \\nboth sampling errors (deviations from the true \\npopulation) and non-sampling errors (human and \\nprocessing errors).  The ACS \\nis released every \\nyear and covers all of the social, economic, \\n\\nhousing, and demographic questions that \\npreviously were covered by the Census long-\\nform.  The 2010 Census only collected data on \\n\\ngender, age, race, ethnicity, relationship, and \\nwhether the respondent owned or rented their \\nhome. \\nUnlike the Census, which attempts to take a \\n\\nsnapshot of the population on April 1\\nst, the ACS \\nprovides consecutive estimates.  Because the \\n\\n\\nnear impossible to pinpoint specific changes that \\nmay have occurred during the time period.  The \\n\\nmajority of the data in this document is from the \\nACS 2010 1-Year Estimate.  Because this data is \\nonly an estimate, the ACS data may not \\naccurately represent the housing climate within \\nthe City.  Due to the fundamental differences in \\n\\ndata, Census data and ACS data cannot be \\ncompared with each other.  When comparing \\nACS data, it is necessary to take the margin of error (MOE) into account.  Numbers that may appear to be \\ndifferent may not actually be \\nstatistically significantly \\ndifferent.  It is important to note the source of any \\nof the data herein and understand the caveats that accompany it.\\n2While data collection is a necessary part of the process to prepare an AI, it is also important to remember \\n\\nthat the AI is meant to be a practical document that identifies impediments to fair housing choice and \\ncreates a systematic plan to remove them.  For the most part, the community is aware of impediments, \\nand those that are not clearly presented in the data are identified through the focus group process \\ndescribed in this document. \\n2 For more information on the ACS and how to appropriately interpret the data, visit \\nwww.census.gov\\n QUICK FACTS\\n 233,209 \\n    population of Madison\\n 102,516  \\n total households\\n 21.1%  \\n  % Minority\\n $29,169    \\nper capita income\\n 18.7%  \\n % individuals below poverty\\n 9.2%  \\n      % of families below poverty\\n 51.8%  \\n % of units that are multi\\n-family\\n 50.7%  \\n % of units renter\\n-occupied\\n 34.6%         \\n % home costs exceeding\\n    affordability\\n 56.7%    \\n% renter costs exceeding\\naffordability\\n Sources:  U.S Census 2010;  ACS 2010 One Yr.

Appendix C should be \\n\\n Demographics\\n The City of Madison population has grown steadily over the \\nlast 30 years, at an average rate of 11% per decade. \\nAccording to the 2010 census, the City population was at \\n\\nthat time 233,209. This is approximately 47.8% of the \\npopulation of Dane County, down from 52.7% in 1980. \\nPercentages of Dane County population residing in certain \\nMadison suburbs, including Fitchburg and Sun Prairie, have \\nincreased over the last 30 years, from 3.7% and 4.0% to \\n\\n5.2% and 6.0% respectively. This indicates a shift in \\npopulation from the City of Madison middle to the suburban \\nedges of the metro area. \\nThe following map, Figure 2-2, shows the population \\n\\ndistribution by Census tract for the City of Madison. Note \\nFigure 2\\n-1: Census Tract Reference Map\\n Source: \\nU.S. Census Bureau, Prepared by City of Madison Planning Division\\n KEY FINDINGS\\n Racial and Ethnic Segregation\\n There are several areas, north and \\nsouth, with disproportionately \\nhigh concentrations of African \\nAmerican and/or Hispanic \\n\\nimilarity \\n\\nsegregation.  This is a direct \\nimpediment to fair housing choice.\\n CITY OF MADISON\\n  2013 MSA Professional Services, Inc.\\n 10 that the map does not depict population density, only population distribution. The most populous tracts \\nare generally suburban growth areas that include more area and have not yet been subdivided to normalize \\nthe population as compared to other, more static tracts. \\nRace and Ethnicity \\n\\nFigure 2-3 shows the residential patterns within the City of Madison by race. As the overall population \\ngrows, the percentage of the population that identifies as minority is also increasing (from 9% in 1990 to \\n\\n21.1% in 2010). According to the 2010 Census, the City of Madison is approximately 78.9% White, 7.3% \\nBlack, 7.4% Asian, 2.9% Other, and 6.8% Hispanic. Hispanic persons can be of any race. Those \\n\\nwhile those identifying as Hispanic are the second \\nfastest growing group. \\nFigure 2\\n-2.

Tracts in red \\nare those with 10% or greater African American residents (2010 \\nCity-wide percentage was 7.3%).  The \\nhighest concentrations, over 20 percent African American residents, are found in the north, south, and \\nsouthwest parts of the City in census tracts 6, 4.07, 14.01 and 23.01. \\nFigure 2\\n-4 Percentage of African American Population by Census Tract \\n Source: U.S. Census Bureau, Prepared by City of Madison Planning Division\\n CITY OF MADISON\\n  2013 MSA Professional Services, Inc.\\n 12 The Asian population is distributed differently across the Madison area.  While the city-wide Asian \\npopulation was 7.4% of the total population in 2000, there are areas in central and west Madison where \\nthe Asian population exceeds 20%.   Specifically there are high concentrations in tracts 3 and 32 with \\npercentages of the total population greater than 20. It should be noted that the concentration of Asian \\n\\npopulation can mostly be attributed to the presence of \\na university population that includes a high \\npercentage of Asian studen\\nts.  This is certainly the case in tract 32, the location of Eagle Heights \\nuniversity housing.\\n  Tract 3 features a large number of apartment units along Sheboygan Avenue, which \\nis popular among graduate students. \\nFigure 2\\n-5 Per\\ncentage of Asian Population by Census Tract \\n Source: U.S. Census Bureau, Prepared by City of Madison Planning Division\\n CITY OF MADISON\\n  2013 MSA Professional Services, Inc.\\n 13 The 2010 Census introduced a new demographic category for those who identify with two or more races\\n. This small portion of the population (3.1% in 2010) was most often found in the same tracts where other \\nminority populations are concentrated, generally north and south parts of the City. The h\\nighest \\nconcentration was 5 percent in tract 23.01.  \\nFigure 2\\n-7 Percentage of Hispanic or Latino Population by Census Tract \\n Source:  U.S. Census Bureau, Prepared by City of Madison Planning Division\\n Figure 2\\n-6 Percentage of Population with 2 or more Races by Census Tract \\nSource: U.S. Census Bureau, Prepared by City of Madison Planni\\nng Division\\n CITY OF MADISON\\n  2013 MSA Professional Services, Inc.\\n 14 The distribution of Latino residents \\nis comparable to that of the African American population, including \\nconcentrations in the South and North areas of the city. Census tracts 6, 14.01, and 15.02 feature a Latino \\npopulation over 20 percent. But, while the Latino population is only a bit smaller than the African \\nAmerican population (6.8% versus 7.3%), the Latino population is relatively more concentrated and \\nsegregated. Of the 64 census tracts with substantial City of Madison populations, just 17 tracts (27%) \\n\\nhave a greater than average concentration of Latino residents, while 23 tracts (36%) have a greater than \\naverage concentration of African American residents.\\n  The greatest concentration of Latino residents is in \\ntwo tracts (14.01 and 6) that are 34% and 35% Latino, whereas the greatest concentration of African \\n\\nAmerican residents is in four tracts (4.07, 6, 14.01, and 23.01) that are 21-23% African American. \\nAnother way to measure concentration and segregation is with the dissimilarity index, which calculates \\n\\nthe percentage of a group that would have to move to be equally distributed across all census tracts as \\ncompared to another group.  This data is available from Brown University \\n(http://www.s4.brown.edu/us2010/segregation2010/Default.aspx\\n).  For African Americans, the 2010 \\nCensus dissimilarity index relative to white residents was 36.6.  For Hispanics it was 31.4, and for Asians \\nit was 29.3.  A score of 30 or lower is considered low, 40-50 moderate, and 60 or more high.  These \\nscores indicate low to moderate segregation in Madison.  There is some segregation, and this does suggest \\n\\nthat housing choice is limited for many minority residents by various factors that lead those residents to \\nchoose housing only in high-minority neighborhoods.\\n  This is a direct \\nimpediment to fair housing choice.\\n Disability \\n\\nTable 2-8 shows the percentage of people in the City \\nof Madison with a disability. As might be expected, \\n\\nthe age group with the greatest prevalence of disability \\nis those who are 65 and older (31%). This data affirms \\nthe assumption that it is the elderly population with the \\ngreatest need for accessible housing. \\nFigure 2-9 indicates the distribution of residents age 65 and older, which can be used as one indicator of \\n\\nwhere people with disabilities are (and are not) living.  The 32 (50%) census tracts with an above-average \\nconcentration of residents age 65 and older are located in all parts of the City. The outlier census tracts in \\n\\nterms of resident age are the university area, where there are five tracts with less than 1% of residents age \\n65-plus, and tract 4.08 on the west side, which has a relatively small total population that includes \\nOakwood Village, a large senior housing complex.  \\nTable 2\\n-8.

SSI is designed to help people who are 65 years or more, blind or \\npeople with disabilities, with little or no income; it provides cash to meet basic needs for food, clothing, \\nand shelter. Figure 2-10 shows the distribution of SSI. Across the City, 2.8% of residents received SSI in \\n\\nthe 2007-2011 sample period. The heaviest concentrations are found in tracts 6 and 15.02 both of which \\n\\nhave greater than 10% of the population receiving \\n\\nSouthside\\n. High concentrations are also found in the North in tracts 23.02, 24.02 and 25, with 8 to 10% receiving \\n\\nSSI. There are also above average concentration in tracts 11.01, 12, 14.01, 23.01, and 26.01, which are \\n\\nlocated in the central, south and north areas of the city.  \\nThis map correlates more closely with measures of income, as illustrated in the following section (see \\nFigures 2-12 and 2-13), than with measures of age (see Figure 2-9). Interpreted in concert with those age \\n\\nand income maps, this map suggests that income is a strong determinant of where people live in Madison, \\nbut age and disability are not. \\nFigure 2\\n-9 Distribution of Residents Over Age 65 by Census Tract \\n Source: U.S. Census Bureau, P\\nrepared by City of Madison Planning Division\\n CITY OF MADISON\\n  2013 MSA Professional Services, Inc.\\n 16 Figure 2\\n-10 Distribution of Residents Receiving SSI by Census Tract \\n Source: U.S. Census Bureau, Prepared by City of Madison Planning Division\\n CITY OF MADISON\\n  2013 MSA Professional Services, Inc.\\n 17 Income and Poverty\\n According to the 2010 American Community \\nSurvey 1-Year Estimates, the median household \\nincome in the City of Madison was $50,508 (See \\nTable 2-11). While we cannot directly compare \\nACS data with the previous Census data, it does \\n\\nindicate an increase in household income within \\nthe City. Despite this, the median household \\nincome in the City is almost 14% less than the \\nmedian household income in Dane County \\n($58,661). Approximately 18.7% of the \\n\\nindividuals in the City are currently below the \\npoverty line; compared to 12.2% of the \\nindividuals in Dane County, 13.2% of individuals \\nin Wisconsin, and 15.1% nation-wide. \\nApproximately 9.2% of the families in Madison \\nare below the poverty line, while only 6.3% of \\nthe families within the Dane County are below \\n\\nthe poverty line. \\nFigure 2-12 shows Median Household Income by Census Tract. This map reinforces the data indicating \\n\\nrelatively low incomes in the City as compared to the County as a whole.  The red tracts are those with \\nhousehold incomes exceeding $80,000.  While only three tracts within the City fall into this category, \\nmost of the nearby tracts outside the City are in this category. \\nTable\\n 2-11.

This reflects the large student population of these tracts rather than true poverty. This \\ndistinction is verified by also considering the use of food stamps, which is a better indicator of poverty \\nthan just income as it reflects eligibility for public assistance to meet basic daily needs.  Figure 2-13 \\nshows the percentage of residents receiving Food Stamps or SNAP (Supplemental Nutritional Assistance) \\n\\nbenefits in the past 12 months, as reported by the Census Bureau.  While 7.6% of residents receive such \\nbenefits city-wide, there are five tracts, shown in blue, with more than 20% of residents receiving such \\nbenefits (14.01, 14.02, 15.02, 23.01, 24.02).  And there are two tracts, shown in purple, with more than \\n30%\\n of resident\\ns receiving these be\\nnefits (6, 25).

All \\ngroups except Hispanics and Female Headed Households are experiencing poverty at a higher rate in \\nMadison than in the state as a whole.  Comparing groups within Madison, there are clear racial and ethnic \\ndisparities.  Whereas about 15% of white residents are considered to be under the federal poverty level, \\nthat number jumps to 16% for Hispanics, 26% for Asian Americans, 31% for female heads of household, \\nand 35% for African Americans.  \\nThese data indicate that  poverty and its associated challenges are disproportionately affecting some \\n\\nprotected classes.

This is consistent with the fact that there are many \\n\\nemployment opportunities distributed throughout the City. Most can reach work within 30 minutes.   \\nIt should be noted, however, that few transit-dependent residents are likely able to reach work within 30 \\n\\nminutes.  A random sample of various trips within the City, mapped using Google Maps, confirms that \\n\\ntransit trips require about three to five times the time required to drive door to door.  For example, a trip \\nfrom South Park Street (Tract 14.01) to Meriter Hospital (Tract 12) takes about 5 minutes to drive, and \\nabout 15 minutes by bus.  Or a trip from South Park Street to the Pflaum Road area east of Stoughton \\nRoad can take 12 minutes by car, but 60-90 minutes by bus and walking, depending on how much \\nwalking someone is willing to do.   \\nTransit trips that take longer than an hour are not only inconvenient, they render some commutes \\n\\nimpossible by transit due to operating schedules that shut down at midnight or earlier.  Second shift \\nworkers often get out of work at 11:00, leaving too little time to return home by bus before service ends \\nfor the night. \\nFigure 2\\n-21.

Almost 28% of housing within the City is \\nmulti-family with 10 or more units. The housing stock \\nin Madison is fairly mixed in terms of age with 43.9% \\nof housing built before 1970 and 56.1% built after \\n\\n1970.  This reflects a history of strong population \\ngrowth and home construction over the past 40 years. \\nFigure 2\\n-22. Unit Type\\n Source: ACS 2010 One\\n-Year Est.\\n Figure 2\\n-23. Year Unit Built\\n Source: ACS 2010 One\\n-Year Est.\\n KEY FINDINGS\\n Housing Stock\\n Housing stock in the City is roughly half \\nsingle\\n-family and half multi\\n-family, \\nincludi\\nng over 25% of units in buildings \\nwith 10 or more units.  The relatively low \\nhome ownership rate is comparable to \\nsimilar and larger cities across the country. \\nThe large student population contributes to \\nthe lower home ownership rate and \\npredominance of s\\nhort\\n-term (less than five \\nyears) occupancy in housing units. The \\nlarge renter population is supported by \\nrobust renter assistance programs and \\nrelatively stronger landlord knowledge. \\nThe supply of single room occupancy \\n(SRO) units has fallen since 2000, l\\nimiting \\nhousing options for the most disadvantaged \\nresidents.\\n The decrease in SRO units is an \\nimpediment to fair housing choice, as it \\ndisproportionately affects non\\n-white and \\ndisabled residents for whom such units \\nmay be the best, maybe the only, viable \\nhousing option. \\n CITY OF MADISON\\n  2013 MSA Professional Services, Inc.\\n 28 Most residents in Madison have not lived in their \\nhome for very long. Over 60% of the 2010 \\npopulation had moved into their current home since \\n2005 (see Table 2-24). A related statistic is the home \\nownership rate \\n renters outnumber home-owners \\nbased on recent estimates (see Table 2-25), which is \\ncommon for communities of similar or greater size \\nacross the country, especially those with large \\nuniversities.  The roughly 42,000 UW-Madison \\nstudents make up about 18% of the Madison \\npopulation, and it can be safely assumed that all but \\n\\na small percentage of these enrolled students are \\nrenters who moved into their units within the past few years. \\nRelatively low home ownership rates and short \\nhousing tenure may be a source of concern for some, \\nespecially in the effort to ensure strong, stable \\nneighborhoods.  However, there are a variety of third-\\n\\nparty organizations that provide training and support \\nfor both renters and property managers in the city.  \\nIndeed, Chapter VI of this report describes a wealth of \\npublic and non-profit entities that support housing \\nneeds in Madison.  In addition, there are private \\n\\ngroups such as the Apartment Association of South \\nCentral Wisconsin that offer training and other resources for landlords and property managers.  Together, \\nthese various entities support a rental market in which landlords have historically been well-informed \\nabout their rights and responsibilities, leading to fewer housing violations.  However, there have been \\nchanges in State and local laws over the past couple years that may not yet be well understood.  Landlord \\neducation efforts remain important. \\nIt is important to note any trends in the supply of \\nvarious housing sizes, in terms of the number of \\nrooms and bedrooms.  Unfortunately, the collection \\n\\nof data shifted from a 100% count in the 2000 \\nCensus to sample estimates in the American \\nCommunity Survey (ACS).  Table 2-26 nevertheless \\ncompares these two data sets.  The data suggests a \\ndecrease in the supply of one-\\nroom housing units, \\nalso known as single room occupancy (SRO) units.  \\nThe 2000 Census reported 5,639 such units, while \\nthe 2007-2011 ACS estimated 4,061 such units.  \\nThis finding, a reduction in the total number of such \\nunits, is consistent with the observations of the local \\nmarket as reported by focus group participants.   \\nSRO units are among the most affordable units in \\nany housing market, and a reduction in the supply of \\nthese units means there are fewer options for the most disadvantaged residents, including those with very \\n\\nlow incomes and those at risk for homelessness.  Those populations are disproportionately non-white and \\nhave a high rate of mental illness, as indicated elsewhere in this chapter. Because of this, the reduced \\nsupply of SRO units is considered an indirect impediment to fair housing choice. \\nTable 2\\n-24.

A five percent vacancy rate is \\ntypically considered ideal, as it provides a good balance \\n\\nbetween the interests of renters and owners.  Table 2-26 \\n\\nincludes homeowner and rental vacancy rates in 2010, as \\nmeasured by the US Census.  Based on this data, the \\nhomeowner vacancy rate was a surprisingly low 2.2%, \\n\\npossibly reflecting the relatively few new housing starts \\n\\nover the prior 2-3 years.  This number indicates a less-than-\\n\\ndesirable market for buyers, meaning less choice. \\nThe 2010 rental vacancy rate was apparently 6.1%, \\naccording to the Census.  Madison Gas & Electric also \\n\\ncollects and reports vacancy data based on the status of \\nelectricity and gas service and payments to units.  Their \\ndata, shown below in Figure 2-23, indicates a clear trend of \\n\\nlower and lower vacancy rates, and generally lower rates \\n\\nthan reported by the Census.  They show an annual average \\n\\nvacancy rate of 3.8% in 2010, and a rate of 2.4% in 2012.  \\nThis data suggests a rental market that favors property \\nowners, reduces housing choices, and increases the \\n\\nlikelihood of discrimination due to the ease of finding \\n\\nrenters.   \\nBased on City permit records (see Figure 2-27), new multi-family, non-condo units (i.e. rental units) \\n\\napproved by the City have been relatively steady at 400-600 units per year over the past decade, excepting \\nspikes in 2005 and 2012 above 1,000 units.  However, single family permits dropped precipitously in \\n2008, below 200 units per year, and have not yet recovered.  This compares to a growth in households of \\nFigure 2\\n-27. Madison Area Rental Vacancy Rates (%)\\n Source: Madison Gas & Electric\\n KEY FINDINGS\\n Housing Vacancy\\n Vacancy rates for both owners and \\nrenters have decreased in recent \\nyears. This suggests li\\nmitations to \\nhousing choice for buyers and \\nrenters, and an increase in the \\nlikelihood of discrimination, \\nespecially against renters.  \\n The low vacancy rate in the entire \\nhousing market, and especially the \\nrental market, is an important, \\nindirect impedimen\\nt to fair \\nhousing choice.\\n CITY OF MADISON\\n  2013 MSA Professional Services, Inc.\\n 30 roughly 1,350  per year 2000-2010, and 1,600 per year 2010-2012 (based on \\na US Census population \\nestimate). The City permit data indicates that total new units approved averaged about 1,160 per year \\n2004-2012, but only 780 per year 2008-2012. \\nThe rental units approved in 2012 are hitting the market in 2013 and should help to increase the vacancy \\n\\nrate.  However, continued new construction is needed to catch up with population growth.  There are, \\nbased on 2010 data and growth projections, about 106,500 households in the City in 2013, and roughly \\n\\n\\nroughly 55,300 rental units on the market.  If we add the 2012 units to those, there are about 56,400 units.  \\n\\nTo achieve a 5% vacancy rate, Madison needs a total of about 57,000 units right now to be at 5% \\nvacancy, or another 600 units to catch up.   \\nAfter the market stabilizes closer to 5% vacancy,  there wil\\nl likely be demand for a \\nnet increase (after \\ndemolitions are subtracted) of about 600 single family and 600 multifamily units per year, on average.  So \\nif 1,200 units were to be approved in 2013, and 600 units per year thereafter, this could meet demand.  \\nData for the first six months of 2013 indicate approval of only 142 new rental units, suggesting the need \\nto monitor closely the market response to the gap between supply and demand.   \\nIt should also be noted that there is concern about the effect on housing \\n\\nrental units, as many of these are downtown and most are expected to be priced at the high end of the \\nmarket. \\nFigure 2\\n-28.

Federal recovery efforts included several rounds of major funding to help \\nstabilize communities with vacant foreclosed properties. Known as the Neighborhood Stabilization \\nProgram and distributed in three successive rounds of funding, this recovery effort included the scoring of \\nevery census tract in the country to determine eligibility for program funds.

There \\nhave been patterns of conventional lending institutions \\nrefusing to extend credit to low-income communities, \\nespecially communities of color.  This practice, known as \\nredlining, made these communities vulnerable to \\nexploitation by less reputable, higher cost lenders that \\nincreased the incidence of fraud and foreclosures.   \\nThe Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) was \\nenacted by Congress in 1975 and is implemented by the \\n\\n\\nprovides the public loan data that can be used to assist in \\ndetermining whether financial institutions are serving the \\nhousing needs of their communities; helping public \\n\\nofficials in distributing public-sector investments; and in \\nidentifying possible discriminatory lending patterns.  This \\n\\nregulation applies to certain financial institutions, \\nincluding banks, savings associations, credit unions, and \\nother mortgage lending institutions.  Institutions that meet \\ncertain minimum thresholds must disclose data regarding \\nthe disposition of applications for mortgage and home \\n\\nimprovement loans in addition to data regarding loan \\noriginations and purchases.  They are required to identify \\nthe race, sex, and income of loan applications, as well as \\nthe physical location of the subject property in census \\ngeography.  \\nFigure 2\\n-32 NSP (NSP3) Risk Score\\n Source: 2010 HUD Neighborhood Stabilization Program\\n KEY FINDINGS\\nLending Policies and Practices\\n The HMDA data show a significant \\ndisproportion in the number of \\nminority applications submitted, and \\nalso in the number denied.

It should be noted that the sample sizes for the \\nminority applicants is small, and that this limits the validity of the sample.  However, the dramatically \\nhigher rejection rates for Hispanic residents is likely a statistically significant difference as compared to \\noutcomes for Whites.  Although this number corresponds with documented discriminatory trends \\nnationally, it is difficult to discern which denials are based on credit worthiness and which are biased, \\n\\nwithout more detailed data comparing denial rate of race for similarly credit-worthy applicants. It tells us, \\nCITY OF MADISON\\n  2013 MSA Professional Services, Inc.\\n 35 at minimum, that Hispanics have fewer housing choices due to fewer attempts and lesser success securing \\nhome loans.   \\nTable 2\\n-34.

This office aids in neighborhood \\nplanning, neighborhood association recognition and \\ndevelopment, neighborhood investment, and navigating \\nCity processes. The services are offered to any \\nneighborhood association or group or individual in the \\nCity of Madison. In addition, the Neighborhood \\nPlanning Section actively provides leadership training \\nand grant funding to engage residents and physically \\nimprove neighborhoods.  \\nNeighborhood plans are prepared with resident input \\nand adopted by reference as an advisory component of \\nthe City comprehensive plan.  Interviews with city staff \\n\\nand direct knowledge of City planning history indicate \\na resistance to new multifamily and/or affordable \\nhousing in some neighborhoods.  This trend is at the \\n\\nneighborhood level, and has the effect of maintaining \\nand enhancing the current concentration of lower-\\n\\nincome and minority residents in certain parts of the \\nCity, despite city-wide policies regarding the inclusion \\nof varied housing types and affordable housing in \\nneighborhoods.  \\nCity of Madison Comprehensive Plan\\n\\n\\nreviewed in 2010-2011) outlines the overarching goals \\nand policies in regards to neighborhood revitalization, \\nmunicipal services, and employment-housing-transportation linkages. Certain sections of the Plan address \\nthese three topics in detail, but the theme of creating an equitable community runs throughout. An \\n\\nemphasis on creating viable and vibrant communities, providing effective and efficient services to all, and \\npromoting the live-work-play linkage serve as the basis for the plan. Specific policies include: \\nWork with employers and businesses to site their businesses near residential dwellings that\\ncould be a source of housing for their employees.\\nPromote workforce housing and walk to work programs that contribute to a level of\\nintegration at the neighborhood level.\\nPromote the development and operation of multi-modal transportation so that housing can be\\n\\nbuilt or expanded along predictable transit zones.\\n\\ng equal opportunities and fair housing.\\nEncourage housing designs that serve people with disabilities.\\nPromote a variety of programs and services to help stabilize housing for other lower income\\nor special needs groups.\\nKEY FINDI\\nNGS Neighborhood Planning, Municipal \\nTransit Services, and the Employment\\n-Housing\\n-Transportation Linkage \\n The City has a current comprehensive plan \\nand is proactive about working with \\nneighborhoods to develop neighborhood \\nplans.

All \\nMetro services work to accommodate residents regardless of ability, socioeconomic status or location.  \\nFixed route buses kneel to accommodate passengers with limited mobility, and provide wheelchair \\nsecurement areas at the front of all buses. Paratransit service is offered on a demand-response, advance \\nreservation basis for persons who are unable to use the standard routes. Users of the paratransit system \\nmust be certified as eligible to receive the service with regard to ADA guidelines. The paratransit routes \\n\\noperate within three-quarters of a mile of fixed-routes and offer door-\\nto-door or curb-\\nto-curb service, \\ndepending on passenger needs. If passengers who are elderly or have a disability live or are traveling \\n\\n\\nHuman Services provides accessible routed group ride and demand-response services.  \\nIn addition to accommodating people with disabilities, Metro offers low income bus passes for eligible \\nriders. These passes are good for 31 days and can be purchased at a discounted fare rate at the Metro \\n\\n. Passes are available \\nfor those filling out a self-certification form that their income is at or below 150% of national poverty \\nguidelines (with an eligibility card renewable every six months). A limited number of passes are available \\neach month.  \\nAs noted in Chapter II, the structure of the Metro Transit hub and transfer routing system can result in \\nvery long commutes between certain parts of the City.  \\nPublic Housing Authority Units and Tenant Selection Procedures\\n The Madison Community Development \\n\\nAuthority owns and operates low-rent public \\nhousing in 40 locations throughout the City \\nof Madison, consisting of 745 units of public \\n\\nhousing, 115 for multi-family housing and \\n24 Section 8 Project Based Voucher \\nHousing units.

Demand for Section 8 vouchers is high \\n waiting lists have been closed since 2007.  \\n\\nApproximately 500 Madison landlords participate in the \\nSection 8 program.\\n  See Figure 3-2 for project locations. \\nParticipation in this program has increased since 2005, \\nwhen CDA staff engaged in outreach efforts with the \\nApartment Association of South Central Wisconsin to \\neducate housing providers on the advantages of working \\nwith the Section  8 program. This effort was recognized \\nby resolution by the City of Madison Common Council.  \\nThen, in 2007, it became illegal per City ordinance to \\n\\ndiscriminate against Section 8 voucher recipients, further \\nexpanding landlord participation. \\n In addition the CDA has established the Section 8 \\n\\nHomeownership Program, The Family Unification \\nVoucher Program, The Veterans Affairs Supportive \\nHousing Program, and the Family Self Sufficiency \\n\\nProgram, all of which help to break down impediments to fair housing. \\nThe CDA provides a housing choice program called the  Section 8 Voucher Program.  Eligible families \\n\\npay between 30-40% of their adjusted income for rent.\\n  The balance is subsidized  by the U.S.  \\nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).  Resident portions of the rent are re-evaluated at \\n\\nincome, criminal background checks, and rental history.   \\nSection 8 also provides that certain units owned or substantially controlled by the Public Housing \\nAuthority (PHA) be eligible for purchase by voucher families participating in the homeownership option.   \\nSection 8 Family Self-Sufficiency Program offers families with Section 8 Vouchers the opportunity to  \\njoin a 5 year, voluntary program to help them become financially independent.  The goal is to help \\n\\nstruggling families find good jobs that earn them enough money to eliminate the need for public \\nassistance by educating, providing job training, counseling and other forms of social assistance.  \\nEligibility for this program is a family income of 50% below the County median income.   \\nFamily Reunification vouchers are issued to families with a lack of decent and safe housing due to \\nseparation or threat of imminent separation.   \\nThe HUD-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing  (HUD-VASH) program combines Housing Choice \\nVoucher (HCV) rental assistance, to support homeless Veterans who are participating in services at \\nVeteran Affairs medical centers.  Eligible veterans must need case management services in order to obtain \\nand sustain independent community housing, have a serious mental illness, substance use disorder \\nhistory, or a physical disability.  In order  to maintain housing candidate must participate in supportive \\nservices or treatment needed for recovery.   \\nKEY FINDINGS\\n Section 8 Vouchers\\n The Madison Community Development \\nAuthority sup\\nports 1,600 households \\nthrough the Section 8 Voucher program. \\n\\ndispersion of vouchers as being very \\ngood. \\n There do not appear to be any \\nimpediments to fair housing choice in \\nthe tenant selection process, though \\nthe limited sup\\nply of units may be an \\nindirect impediment to fair housing \\nchoice.\\n CITY OF MADISON\\n  2013 MSA Professional Services, Inc.\\n 52 Informational Programs\\n The Equal Opportunities Division (EOD) provides free \\ncommunity education and technical assistance with regard \\nto rights and responsibilities to employers, job seekers, \\nemployees,   case manager, advocates, and the general \\npublic. The EOD has been providing the series of \\n\\nworkshops for many years, though most of the workshops \\naddress workplace discrimination rather than housing \\ndiscrimination, likely due to the greater numbers of \\nworkplace-related complaints.   In 2012 the EOD offered \\neach of the workshops to the general public with a \\n\\ndifferent topic scheduled each month. They also offer to \\ncater the workshops to specific companies or \\norganizations to fit their needs and schedules. The EOD \\nprovides the PowerPoint presentations to any who request \\nthem and also have a bilingual staff available to present in \\nboth English and Spanish when needed.  \\nSale of Subsidized Housing and Possible Displacement\\n The City of Madison adheres to HUD regulations \\nregarding displacement, including providing relocation \\nassistance as provided in the Uniform Relocation \\nAssistance and Real Property Acquisition Act of 1970  \\nThese apply not only to subsidized housing, but any \\nacquisition of housing using federal funds, including \\nnon-profit developers using HOME, CBDG and other \\nfederal sources.  The CDBG office has a policy to \\nminimize displacement, only participating in changes to \\noccupied projects deemed absolutely necessary.  An \\nanti-displacement policy is included in the Action Plan \\nand 5-Year Plan. One issue of concern raised by a non-profit housing \\norganization is the possibility that the City has used the \\nchronic nuisance ordinance as a tool to encourage \\nevictions prior to redevelopment projects to avoid providing relocation assistance.  This concern is \\n\\nunsubstantiated, however it is recognized that the nuisance laws are invoked most often in poor and \\nminority neighborhoods, where voucher use is more common.  These activities have value in the ongoing \\neffort to maintain safe and stable neighborhoods, and their use in connection with potential \\nredevelopment properties should be careful. \\nKEY FINDINGS\\nDisplacement and Relocation \\nAssistance\\n The C\\nity has the right policies in place to \\nhelp people relocate when their housing \\nis to be sold or eliminated, as for a \\nredevelopment project, and federal funds \\nare used.\\n  No impediments to fair \\nhousing choice are identified.\\n Informational Programs\\n Welcoming Diversity\\n Fair Employment Practices\\n Preventing Harassment in the Workplace\\n Hate Crimes\\n Housing Discrimination \\n Public Accommodations\\n How to Avoid Retail Ra\\ncial Profiling\\n Youth at Work\\n Arrest Records and Conviction Records\\n Protected Classes\\n Genetic Information Non\\n-Discrimination Act\\n Equal Opportunity Division Services\\n Gender Identity\\n Credit History\\n CITY OF MADISON\\n  2013 MSA Professional Services, Inc.\\n 53 Property Tax\\n Policies\\n Figure 3-3 shows that full value property tax rates in the \\nCity of Madison have generally been increasing over the \\n\\nproperty tax divided by the full value. This rate is preferred \\nto the general property tax local rate for making \\n\\ncomparisons between tax districts because all taxable \\ngeneral property is valued at the same level. However, it \\nmust be taken into consideration that this is an average rate, \\nand that surplus funds may have been applied to reduce the \\n\\n\\nstate property tax credit (not including lottery credit) \\ndivided by the full value. The effective rate is an average \\nrate. Figure 3-4 shows 2010 mill rates for cities in Dane \\nCounty. The rate for most of Madison, those parts that are \\nwithin the Madison school district, is in the middle of the \\n\\nof other school districts, the rates are the highest in the \\n\\ncounty.   \\nWhile higher property taxes may affect the affordability of \\nhousing overall in relation to neighboring communities, \\nMadison property tax policies are considered to be equitable \\n\\namongst all homeowners. In addition, residents with a \\nhousehold income of $24,680 or less (2011) are eligible for \\nthe Homestead Tax Credit, which eliminates the state \\nproperty tax obligation for renters, homeowners, those who \\nreside in mobile or manufactured homes, and those in \\nnursing homes. \\nFigure 3\\n-4.

The relevant brochures and forms are \\nlocated under the Department of Civil Rights \\n(http://www.cityofmadison.com/dcr/fileComplaint.cfm\\n).  \\nMost of the forms and instructions are generalized for use \\nwith any type of discrimination complaint, which makes \\nthem harder to understand from the perspective of the fair \\nhousing complainant. There is currently no apparent link from the CDA/Housing Operations Division \\nweb page (\\nhttp://www.cityofmadison.com/formshousing/index.htm\\n) to the DCR complaint materials, \\nthough there is a link to the HUD complaint process. \\nGoogle searches for common terms and phrases do not currently \\n\\ndiscrimination complaint resources.  \\n\\n leads to t\\n\\nwhich does not include housing discrimination as a reportable problem.  \\n\\n\\n leads to a PDF report about housing discrimination, or the private Tenant Resource \\nCenter.  \\n\\n leads to the private Fair Housing Council.  Both the Tenant Resource \\nCenter and the Fair Housing Council are good sources of information and counsel, but it is very difficult \\n\\ncomplaint options directly via the City website (as of August \\n2013). \\nOnce initiated, the complaint process with EOD begins with the filing of a short complaint form.  An \\ninvestigator \\n\\nthe investigation is completed, resulting in \\n\\n If probable cause is found, the parties will be asked if they would like to undergo the conciliation process \\nand settle without need for a hearing. If this is not agreed upon, the case will proceed to a hearing on the \\n\\nmerits. \\nParties have an opportunity to be heard before the hearing examiner. Both parties may choose to be \\nrepresented by an attorney or advocate or may represent themselves. All evidence must be presented at \\nthe hearing. The examiner will make a decision (called Recommended Findings of Fact, Conclusion of \\nLaw and Order) on whether or not discrimination occurred and will include a remedy or reason why no \\ndiscrimination was found. Decisions may be appealed to the Equal Opportunities Commission, but no \\n\\nnew evidence will be considered. \\n\\n KEY FINDINGS\\n City Complaint Process\\n The complaint process within the City of \\nMadison seems to be handled well and \\n\\nweb\\n-based materials and site structure are \\ntoo cumbersome to navigate.  \\n Difficulty figuring out how t\\no file a \\ncomplaint is likely suppressing some \\ncomplaints and limiting enforcement of \\nfair housing laws.  This is an indirect \\nimpediment to fair housing choice in the \\ncity.\\n CITY OF MADISON\\n  2013 MSA Professional Services, Inc.\\n 58 State\\n of Wisconsin\\n and Federal\\n Fair Housing Complaint Process\\n The State of Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development, Equal Rights Division accepts \\ncomplaints from or on behalf of a person alleging discrimination within 1 year of the discriminatory \\naction.  The process begins with the filing of a four page complaint form.  A hearing is held, and the \\ndecision may be appealed to the Labor and Industry Review Commission (LIRC), which decision may be \\nappealed to court. Procedure for these appeals differ.  A civil action may be filed, taking the complaint \\n\\ndirectly to court.  A civil action may include damages, including punitive damages, court costs and \\nreasonable attorney fees. Complaint forms are readily accessible on the agency website.   \\nThe U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development housing discrimination complaint process can \\nbe an 8 step process, beginning  with a filing a short complaint.  The complaint is reviewed by a fair \\n\\nhousing specialist to determine if the alleged acts violate the Fair Housing Act.  If there is evidence of a \\npossible violation of the Act, the specialist will assist the complainant in filing an official housing \\ndiscrimination complaint.\\n  HUD investigates the complaints at no cost to the complainant.\\n   The \\ninvestigation will collect relevant documents or conduct on site visits, as appropriate.\\n  The Fair Housing \\nAct requires parties to b\\ne brought together to attempt conciliation on every complaint, if the parties sign \\n\\n\\ncause that housing discrimination has occurred or is about to occur and closes the case.    If the \\n\\ninvestigation yields reasonable cause  that discrimination has occurred and the law has been violated, \\nHUD will issue a charge.  A HUD Administration Law Judge (ALJ) will hear the case, unless the party \\nelects to have the case heard in federal civil court.   Complaint forms are readily accessible on the agency \\nwebsite.   \\nDocumented \\nFair Housing \\nComplaints and \\nDiscrimination Suits\\n As previously mentioned, there are four layers of fair \\nhousing protections in place within the City of Madison:  \\nthe City, the County, the State of Wisconsin, and the federal \\n\\nfair housing laws.  While the protected classes for each \\nlayer of law differs slightly, a victim of fair housing \\ndiscrimination can file a discrimination suit with any (or all) \\nof the applicable layers of government.  \\nFair Housing Complaints Filed with the City of Madison\\n In the period 2010-2012 there were a total of 45 housing-\\nrelated discrimination complaints documented by the City \\nof Madison. Table 3- 6 categorizes the 45 complaints \\naccording to the protected class status of the complainant. \\n\\nRace or color was cited as a factor in nearly half (22 and 18 \\nrespectively) of the 45 complaints, followed in frequency by \\ndisability.  Conviction record was a frequent source of \\ncomplaints prior to its invalidation as a protected class by \\nState Act 108 in 2012, which rendered certain local fair \\nhousing laws unenforceable. The disposition of these 45 \\ncases include 15 that \\n\\nfour that were \\n\\nthat \\n\\ntwo that \\n\\nfive that were still \\n\\n KEY FINDINGS\\n Complaints and Suits\\n It is widely understood that the 45 housing \\ndisc\\nrimination complaints filed in the City \\nover three years vastly underestimates the \\nincidence of discrimination  in the City. \\nPeople in search of housing are usually \\nfocused on that important objective, and \\ndo not have the time or energy to pursue a \\ncompla\\nint.  \\n While we cannot get an accurate \\nmeasure of discrimination, we know \\nthat it is occurring and is an \\nimpediment to fair housing choice for \\nvarious protected classes in the City.\\n CITY OF MADISON\\n  2013 MSA Professional Services, Inc.\\n 59 Table 3\\n-7: Complaints to the City of Madison\\n Source: City\\n of Madison\\n Year 2010 2011 2012 Total\\n Percent\\n Total\\n 13 19 13 45 Type\\n Race\\n 5 6 11 22 20.75%\\n Color\\n 5 5 8 18 16.98%\\n Conviction Record\\n 4 9 0 13 12.26%\\n Disability\\n 3 5 4 12 11.32%\\n Age \\n2 1 6 9 8.49%\\n Sex\\n 2 2 2 6 5.66%\\n National Origin\\n 2 2 1 5 4.72%\\n Marital Status\\n 1 0 3 4 3.77%\\n Source of Income\\n 1 1 2 4 3.77%\\n Familial Status\\n 1 0 2 3 2.83%\\n Victim of Domestic Abuse\\n 0 2 1 3 2.83%\\n Political Beliefs\\n 0 1 1 2 1.89%\\n Arrest Record\\n 2 0 0 2 1.89%\\n Citizenship\\n 0 1 0 1 0.94%\\n Gender Identity\\n 1 0 0 1 0.94%\\n Sexual Orientation\\n 1 0 0 1 0.94%\\n Credit History\\n 0 0 0 0 0.00%\\n Less than Honorable \\nDischarge\\n 0 0 0 0 0.00%\\n Physical Appearance\\n 0 0 0 0 0.00%\\n Religion\\n 0 0 0 0 0.00%\\n Student Status\\n 0 0 0 0 0.00%\\n 30 35 41 106 100.00%\\n Fair Housing Complaints Filed with HUD\\n For the 5-year period 2008 to 2012, there were a total of 32 \\ncases filed with the federal Department of Housing and \\nUrban Development (HUD) for the City of Madison, an \\naverage of about six per year.

There were several impediment themes which were common \\n\\nthroughout all of the focus groups including low vacancy rates and high rents, Not In My Back Yard \\nattitudes (NIMBY-ism), unwillingness of those discriminated to file a complaint, and inadequate landlord \\neducation. Most of these issues are impediments to safe housing in some way, but only a portion are \\nimpediments to fair housing choice due to a disproportionate impact on members of a protected class. \\nThose considered to be true impediments to fair housing choice in the City of Madison are italicized. \\nWhile a reflection only of the opinions of the participants, they are the informed opinions of people who \\n\\nwork in and understand housing issues in the City and region.

For this analysis we utilized a survey, available either in paper form \\nor online, which asked respondents to report their experiences, if any, with difficulty securing housing.  \\nThis survey was not intended to be a measurement of the incidence of illegal discrimination.  It was, \\ninstead, a search for anecdotal feedback that might illustrate known impediments or identify for further \\nstudy impediments not otherwise known. \\nThe survey effort garnered 83 responses.

Selection and priori\\nti\\nzation of action items should \\noccur in subsequent planning processes.\\n  \\n \\n \\nImplementation of these actions will require the coordi\\nnated effort of various groups in and outside City \\ngovernment, including Common Council, various committees, city staff, and sometimes private sector \\n\\nactor, a generalization \\nintend\\ned to capture all of those parties.  A summary table of these actions provided in the Executive \\nSummary offers specific responsibility assignments for each action.\\n \\n1.\\n \\nSupply Impediments (Private\\n \\nSector\\n)\\n \\n1.1 \\n \\nInadequate Supply of Rental Housing\\n \\n(Indirect Imped\\niment)\\n \\nBased on stakeholder interviews and analysis of available data, \\nthe most important impediment to fair \\nhousing choice at this time is the low supply of rental units\\n.  While 5% vacancy is generally considered an \\nappropriate balance between the interes\\nts of renters and the interests of landlords,  the rate dropped to \\nabout 2.5% in late 2012.  This enables landlords to be selective when choosing renters, and increases the \\nlikelihood of \\nillegal discrimination.  It gets harder to recognize or prove illegal\\n \\ndiscrimination when there \\nare multiple applicants pursuing units.\\n \\n \\nPermit approvals for new rental units jumped \\nsharply \\nin 2012, but sustained new construction will be \\nnecessary to bring the vacancy rate back up to a safe \\nlevel.\\n \\n \\nCITY OF MADISON\\n  2013 MSA Professional Services, Inc.\\n 69 Recommended Actions: \\n 1.1.1 The City should establish policies that seek to establish and maintain a 5% city-wide rental \\nvacancy rate.  This target should be noted in the comprehensive plan and the vacancy rate should \\nbe noted in planning staff reviews of proposed new rental units. \\n1.1.2 The City should encourage building and development designs that accommodate and allow either \\n\\nrental or condominium use, or both at the same time, to improve flexibility in response to market \\n\\nshifts. \\n1.1.3 The City should consider various programs and incentives to encourage new rental unit \\n\\ndevelopment.  Consider programs implemented by the City of Vancouver, including required \\nreplacement of demolished units, incentives and ideas to encourage accessory dwelling units, and  \\nincentives to protect units for rental use for 60 years. \\n1.2  Inadequate Supply of \\nLarger \\nAssisted Rental \\nUnits \\n(Indirect Impediment) \\nBased on stakeholder feedback and Public Housing Authority data, \\nthere is unmet demand for large rental \\nunits available to lower-income residents affecting the ability of larger families with limited incomes to \\n\\nfind housing.  This is having a disproportionate effect on Hispanic residents due to the prevalence of \\n\\nlarger families, making it an indirect impediment to fair housing choice. \\nRecommended Actions: \\n 1.2.1 The City should encourage the inclusion of a wider variety of unit sizes in new multifamily \\n\\ndevelopments, especially including three-bedroom options in affordable housing projects.  \\n\\nIncentives should be considered as an option to encourage such units, such as a density bonus or \\ncash contribution to compensate for the loss of smaller units. \\n1.3  Inadequate Supply of Single Room Occupancy Units  (Indirect Impediment) \\nSingle room occupancy units provide choices for residents that may have few other choices.  An adequat\\ne supply helps to prevent homelessness.  The apparent decline in the supply of these units is an indirect \\nimpediment to the fair housing choice of low-income and disabled residents, and it increases the risk of \\nprevalence of homelessness. \\nRecommended Action:\\n1.3.1 The Housing Strategy Committee should further study this supply gap and offer strategies to fill \\nit.  The City should focus especially on the supply of units for residents with special needs in its \\n\\nvarious programs and policies to reduce homelessness. \\n2.Affordability Impediments (Private Sector)\\n2.1 Inadequate Supply of Affordable \\nHousing \\n(Indirect Impediment) \\nAffordability is not, by itself, a fair housing issue, because income is not a protected class.  However, due \\nto the strong correlation between income and race and ethnicity, such that minority residents make up a \\n\\n-income population, the limited supply of affordable units has the \\neffect of restricting housing choice for minority residents.  This is an indirect impediment to fair housing. \\nRecommended Actions:\\n 2.1.1 The City should evaluate and define housing demand at various income levels as part of a \\n\\nComprehensive Housing Strategy that sets targets and strategies for  new unit creation. \\n2.1.2 The City should continue to encourage the inclusion of affordable units in development and \\n\\nredevelopment plans in all parts of the City, at least\\n including units deemed affordable to low \\nCITY OF MADISON\\n  2013 MSA Professional Services, Inc.\\n 70 income (80% of County Median Income) and very low income (50% of County Median Income) \\nresidents.   \\n2.1.3 The City should implement policies and programs to mitigate the replacement of affordable \\nmarket rate housing by high-end market rate housing.  Aging units that remain safe and \\nserviceable are an important aspect of the local housing market.  Programs may include \\nincentives for rehabilitation and a requisite analysis of demand for housing whenever a new \\n\\nproject would eliminate units, to include demand for the units to be lost and the units to be \\ncreated. \\n2.1.4 The City should encourage and facilitate the development of non-traditional housing types and \\n\\nownership structures to increase affordable options in both new and existing neighborhoods\\n, including community land trusts, \\nco-housing, cooperative housing and accessory dwelling units.\\n  This may include the relaxing of the permit process for cooperative housing in 1-3 family units \\n\\noutside the downtown area. \\n3.Financial Impediments (Private Sector)\\n3.1 Lack of Loans to Minorities \\n(Indirect Impediment) \\nThe HDMA data show that minorities, especially African Americans and Latinos, are less likely to \\n\\noriginate a conventional loan and more likely to be denied. If they secure a loan, it is more likely to be a \\nnon-conventional loan.  The inability to secure a mortgage, refinance, or home improvement loan is \\n\\nclearly a barrier to housing choice.  This is an indirect impediment that the City should work to eliminate. \\nRecommended Actions: \\n  \\n3.1.1 The City and the Homebuyers Roundtable should collaborate to provide more credit and home-\\n\\nbuying education to citizens, especially minority residents.  Training should address how \\n\\ncondominiums work, and all training should be offered in both English and Spanish. \\n3.1.2 The City and the Homebuyers Roundtable should provide education and information for local \\nlenders on predatory lending practices and common pitfalls for new buyers, to ensure that efforts \\nto reduce the racial disparities in loan origination do not have the unintended consequence of \\nincreased rates of default and foreclosure among minority borrowers. \\n3.1.3 The City could address the apparent lesser interest in home ownership among minority residents \\nby doing more to improve the success of minority homebuyers post-purchase. The City could \\noffer workshops and training on the physical aspects of maintaining a home, energy conservation, \\nbudgeting, rehabilitation programs, home improvement loans, refinancing, money management \\nand foreclosure prevention. \\n3.1.4 The City and the Homebuyers Roundtable should collaborate to encourage local lenders to take \\nsteps themselves to Affirmatively Further Fair Housing and to ensure they are extending credit to \\nunderserved communities. \\n3.1.5 The City could further target its home loan programs toward racial and ethnic households and \\n\\nneighborhoods. \\n3.1.6 \\n-based loan program information should be made easier to find and understand. \\n4.Spatial Impediments (Public and Private Sector)\\n4.1 Assisted/Subsidized Housing Projects Directed Toward Low Income Neighborhoods \\n(Indirect Impediment) \\nMultiple factors have tended to result in the development of assisted and subsidized housing units in low \\n\\nincome neighborhoods, including the perception that that is where the units should be, stronger resistance \\n\\nfrom neighbors in other neighborhoods, and the relatively lower cost of land in those neighborhoods.  It \\nCITY OF MADISON\\n  2013 MSA Professional Services, Inc.\\n 71 would be a greater benefit to low-income residents \\nif proximity to concentrations of jobs,\\n employers\\n, transit, schools, and other community amenities were considered in the siting of such units. \\nRecommended Actions: \\n 4.1.1 Plan Commission and Council members should resist the influence of strong neighborhood \\ngroups if and when those groups seek to block affordable housing projects in existing \\n\\nneighborhoods.  The new zoning ordinance should be used to streamline the approval process \\nwhen appropriate.   \\n4.1.2 City planning staff should collaborate with the CDA, WHEDA, and other housing subsidy \\n\\nfunding entities to direct new assisted and subsidized units to neighborhoods that do not already \\nhave concentrations of such units.    \\n4.1.3 The City should develop a Comprehensive Housing Strategy to define and facilitate thoughtful \\nhousing development.  This may include the identification of High Opportunity Zones and Low \\nOpportunity Zones where new affordable units (market rate or subsidized) are either specifically \\nencouraged or specifically discouraged. \\n4.1.4 The City should consider the creation of a tiered development review permit system that ties the \\npermit cost to the price point of the proposed units (rental or owned). \\n4.2 Racial Segregation (Direct Impediment) \\nThe City has mild to moderate racial and ethnic segregation.  This indicates a real or perceived lack of \\nhousing choices for African American and Hispanic residents outside of neighborhoods where each \\n\\nminority group is concentrated (primarily north and south sides of the City).\\n  This is a symptom of othe\\nr issues, especially the income disparities for African American and Hispanic residents, but it is also a \\n\\ncause, an impediment itself, because the physical segregation perpetuates the conditions that lead to \\ndiffering outcomes and fewer housing choices for African American and Hispanic residents.  It should be \\nnoted that many of the actions recommended in this report have potential to reduce racial segregation, \\nespecially the actions to increase the supply of rental housing and affordable housing throughout the city, \\nand all of the actions in this section addressing spatial disparities and impediments. \\nRecommended Actions: \\n 4.2.1 The City should specifically acknowledge and address racial segregation and concentrations of \\nracial and ethnic minorities, especially on the north and south sides, in the Comprehensive Plan, \\nneighborhood plans, the Comprehensive Housing Strategy, and the 5 year Consolidated Plan for \\n\\nHUD funding.  \\n4.3 Transit Commuting Difficult at Some Times and Locations \\n(Indirect Impediment) \\nThe relative difficulty reaching some parts of the City by bus in a timely manner is an impediment \\nbecause it limits where a transit-dependent resident can choose to live and/or work.\\n  Schedule limitations \\naffecting some 2\\nnd shift employees are also a concern. \\nRecommended Actions: \\n 4.3.1 The City should continue to evaluate changes to the transit routing system and schedules\\n, including the potential for later routes that better support second shift employment and \\n\\ndevelopment of express modes such as bus rapid transit.\\n  This evaluation should address the \\nneeds of and impact on neighborhoods with concentrations of low-income and minority residents. \\n4.3.2 The City should direct new assisted and subsidized units toward key transit corridors, to put more \\nresidents close to transit lines for improved access to schools and jobs. \\nCITY OF MADISON\\n  2013 MSA Professional Services, Inc.\\n 72 4.4 Poor Grocery Store Access in Some Minority Neighborhoods (Indirect Impediment) \\nThere are areas on the south side of the city where minority residents are more concentrated and that  are \\nnot within walking distance of a grocery store.  This is an indirect impediment to fair housing choice, as it \\nmay be disproportionately limiting the ability of racial/ethnic minority residents to maintain healthy diets.   \\nRecommended Actions: \\n 4.4.1 The City should support development and/or services that enable daily access to fresh food in all \\nneighborhoods.  \\n5.Administrative Impediments (Public Sector)\\n5.1 Limited Use of Fair Housing Complaint Procedures \\n(Indirect Impediment) \\nThe low numbers of complaints and feedback through the community survey suggest that \\n\\n\\n\\nOnce initiated, t\\n\\nh its \\nfocus on early mediation. However, it is difficult to figure out how to file a housing discrimination \\n\\n\\n Recommended Actions: \\n  \\n5.1.1 The City should evaluate and simplify the presentation of materials associated with fair housing \\n\\ncomplaints, from the perspective of a complainant.  Emphasize the ease of the complaint process \\n\\n\\n 5.1.2 The City should o\\n\\nensur\\n\\n\\n\\nComplaint page for the benefit of people who land there when searching for fair housing \\n\\ninformation. \\n5.1.3 The Building Inspection Department and the Department of Civil Rights should have coordinated \\n\\ntraining so that they know each other and recognize all types of housing-related complaints and \\nviolations, and can smoothly guide and refer complainants to the appropriate office and staff \\nperson. \\n5.1.4 \\ntype of problem.   Staff resources may need to be enhanced to identify and distinguish between \\nfair housing and safe housing issues and direct each to the appropriate agency or department. \\n5.1.5 The City should consider contracting with a Qualified Fair Housing Enforcement Organization to \\n\\nprovide additional investigative services, including testing. \\n5.1.6 The City and County should revise their fair housing ordinances to be consistent with state law, to \\nreduce confusion. \\n5.2 Uncertain Implementation Strategy and Responsibility \\n(Indirect Impediment) \\nAn extended vacancy in the Community Development Division (CDD) Director position and a prolonged \\nand continued vacancy (over a year) in the supervisor position of the Community Development Block \\nGrant (CDBG) Office have created organizational deficiencies which, if unaddressed, would raise \\nconcern about the ability to address impediments identified in this report.   \\nRecommended Actions:\\n 5.2.1 The Director of Planning \\n& Community \\n& Economic Development should clearly identify and \\ndefine staff roles and responsibilities for monitoring and implementing fair housing issues and \\n\\ninitiatives.\\n  The lead role may be a CDBG Grants Supervisor, but other roles in various City \\nagencies should also be defined and charged with implementation. \\nCITY OF MADISON\\n  2013 MSA Professional Services, Inc.\\n 73 5.2.2 City staff should improve coordination and collaboration between the CDBG office (or other \\nentity designated with responsibility for fair housing), the CDA,  and the Department of Civil \\nRights, including clear identification of the roles for each agency in the effort to Affirmatively \\nFurther Fair Housing.   \\n5.2.3 The City should consider streamlining all home ownership funding programs to put them under \\n\\nthe management of one City department.\\n  Or, at minimum, collaboration and communication \\nshould be prioritized and information about the various policies, programs and housing resources \\nshould be presented in a more streamlined manner, such that the departmental structure \\nsupporting those programs is invisible and irrelevant to the end user.  \\n5.3 Zoning Code Permits Concentration of Disabled Residents (Indirect Impediment) \\nThe zoning ordinance allows Community Living Arrangements to have more than 15 residents, in some \\ncases.  This could result in an illegal segregation of these residents and could become an impediment to \\nfair housing choice.  \\nRecommended Actions:\\n 5.3.1 Planning and Civil Rights staff should monitor the development of larger group home \\nestablishments and consider revisions to the zoning ordinance to prevent violation of the \\n\\n 5.4 Protected Classes Underrepresented on Boards and Commissions (Indirect \\nImpediment) \\nAfrican Americans, Asian Americans,\\n  Hispanics, disabled persons and women  are unrepresented or \\nunderrepresented in key boards and commissions, creating a higher risk for decisions that could result in \\nimpediments to fair housing choice.  This is an issue of concern for the Plan Commission, the Housing \\nStrategy Committee, the Community Development Block Grant Committee, the Equal Opportunities \\nCommission, the Commission on People with Disabilities and the Community Development Authority. \\nRecommended Actions:\\n 5.4.1 The City should continue to actively recruit protected class representatives to each of these \\ncommittees, including women, African Americans, Hispanics, and disabled persons. \\nCITY OF MADISON\\n  2013 MSA Professional Services, Inc.\\n A-1 Appendix A: Zoning Code Term Definitions\\n Term definitions come from the City of Madison Zoning Code. \\nAccessory Building or Use\\n- \\nAn accessory building or use is one which: \\n1.Is customary and clearly incidental to the principal building or principal use;\\n2.Serves exclusively the principal building or principal use;\\n3.Is subordinate in floor area, extent or purpose to the principal building or principal use served\\nor is a secondary dwelling unit; \\n4.Contributes to the comfort, convenience or necessity of occupants of the principal building or\\nprincipal use served; and \\n5.Is located on the same zoning lot as the principal building or principal use served, with the\\nsingle exception of such accessory off-street parking facilities as are permitted to locate \\nelsewhere than on the same zoning lot as the building or use served.  \\nAn accessory building or use includes, but is not limited to, the following: \\n\\n2.A garage, carport, compost bin, shed or building for storage incidental to a permitted use;\\n3.Incinerators incidental to a permitted use;\\n4.Storage of goods used in or produced by permitted manufacturing activities on the same zoning\\nlot with such activities, unless such storage is excluded by the district regulations; \\n5.The production, processing, cleaning, servicing, testing, repair or storage of merchandise\\nnormally incidental to a permitted retail service or business use if conducted by the same \\nownership as the principal use;  \\n6.Off-street motor vehicle parking areas and loading facilities; and\\n7.Signs, as permitted and regulated in each district incorporated in this ordinance.\\n8.Keeping of chickens, as permitted and regulated in each district incorporated in this ordinance.\\n9.Secondary dwelling units.\\n10.Yard sales.\\nAdult Day Care Facility\\n- An adult day care facility is a facility other than an adult family day care home \\nin which for compensation or consideration, three (3) or more adults who have difficulty in \\nfunctioning independently receive daytime group companionship and care. \\nAdult Family Day Care Home\\n- An adult family day care home is a dwelling where, for compensation or \\nconsideration, a resident of the dwelling provides daytime group companionship and care for at least \\nthree (3) but not more than five (5) adults who have difficulty in functioning independently at a \\nlocation other than the home of those receiving care or the home of their relatives.  \\nAdult Family Home\\n- An adult family home is a private residence, licensed, operated, certified or \\npermitted under the authority of the Department of Health and Family Services of the State of \\nWisconsin, where care and maintenance above the level of room and board but not including nursing \\ncare, are provided for three (3) or four (4) developmentally disabled adults (or more if all adults are \\nsiblings) by a care provider whose primary domicile is the residence; or a place where three (3) or \\n\\nfour (4) adults who are not related to the operator reside and receive care, treatment or service that is \\nabove the level of room and board and may include up to seven (7) hours per week of nursing care \\nper resident.

The practice of providing equal opportunities in housing, employment,\\n \\npublic accommodations and City facilities to persons without reg\\nard to sex, race, religion, color, \\nnational origin or ancestry, citizenship status, age, handicap/disability, marital status, source of \\nincome, arrest record, conviction record, less than honorable discharge, physical appearance, \\nsexual  orientation,  gend\\ner  identity,  genetic  identity,  political  beliefs,  familial  status,  student \\nstatus, domestic partnership status, receipt of rental assistance, or status as a victim of domestic \\nabuse, sexual assault, or stalking is a desirable goal of the City of Ma\\ndison and a matter of \\n\\nvisitors endangers the rights and privileges of all.   The denial of equal opportunity intensifies \\ngroup conflict, undermines the foundations \\nof our democratic society, and adversely affects the \\ngeneral welfare of the community.  Denial of equal opportunity in employment deprives the \\ncommunity of the fullest productive capacity of those of its members so discriminated against and \\ndenies to them \\nthe sufficiency of earnings necessary to maintain the standards of living consistent \\nwith their abilities and talents.  Therefore, as a proper function of City government the City of \\nMadison has provided in Sec. 39.02 for affirmative action in City employm\\nent to safeguard \\nagainst discrimination.  Denial of equal opportunity in housing compels individuals and families \\nwho are discriminated against to live in dwellings below the standards to which they are entitled. \\nDenial of equal opportunity in public accom\\nmodations subjects those discriminated against to \\nembarrassment and creates distress and unrest within the community.  Provision for adequate \\nsafeguards against such discrimination is a proper and necessary function of City government.  In \\norder that the p\\neace, freedom, safety and general welfare of all inhabitants of the City may be \\nprotected and ensured, it is hereby declared to be the public policy of the City of Madison to \\nfoster and enforce to the fullest extent the protection by law of the rights of a\\nll of its inhabitants to \\nequal opportunity to gainful employment, housing, and the use of City facilities and public \\naccommodations  without  regard  to  sex,  race,  religion,  color,  national  origin  or  ancestry, \\ncitizenship status, age, handicap/disa\\nbility, marital status, source of income, arrest record, \\nconviction record, less than honorable discharge, physical appearance, sexual orientation, gender \\nidentity, genetic identity, political beliefs, familial status, student status, domestic partnership \\nstatus, or status as a victim of domestic abuse, sexual assault, or stalking.  To fully effectuate this \\npolicy of promoting nondiscrimination, the City shall endeavor to eliminate all discrimination \\nthat may occur in its own employment, housing, and public\\n \\naccommodation practices and in the \\nuse of City facilities. By adopting Sec. 39.05 of these ordinances, the Common Council has \\nattempted to make sure that City facilities and programs that receive City financial assistance are \\naccessible to all persons, in\\ncluding persons with disabilities. The City will deal positively and \\nconstructively  with  all  claims  of  discrimination  filed  against  it  through  utilization  of  the \\nprocedures outlined in this ordinance.
